# face_detection_project
This repository contains a project which is based on Computer Vision. A face recognition model that is made using Python and open_cv with some Machine Learning implementations.
Programming language used: Python

Packages used: open_cv: for main scripting,
               os: to handle operations related to operating systems
               numpy: for handling complex mathematical calculations.
               
Algorithms used: haarcascade_frotalface_default.xml
Algorithm used for training the model: trainer.yaml (see in the trainer folder)
